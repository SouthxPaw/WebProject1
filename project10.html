<span class="textFloat1">You start picking up the pieces of the photograph.<br>
All of the pieces form together.<br>
"Is that...that woman?"<br>
"This looks like a picture of her with a family? I wonder what happened to her....and them..."<br>
"I don't know why I'm here. There has to be a reason."<br>
The house starts to rumble and you feel the floor shaking beneath you.<br>
It stops...<br>
You hear a voice, "You have been chosen."<br>
The door creaks open.
